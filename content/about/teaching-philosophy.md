# Education in Times of Uncertainty

We are living through a moment of profound uncertainty. Rapid technological change, shifting economies, ecological instability, and social complexity mean the world our students inherit looks different from the worlds we once knew. The familiar patterns of the past no longer map neatly onto the future. Yet uncertainty itself is not new — it is simply information we have not yet interpreted.

As a mathematician, I take comfort in what the discipline teaches: uncertainty is not chaos. Probability helps us make good decisions without guarantees. Logic gives us a framework for clarity even when answers are not immediate. Dynamical systems show how small changes alter trajectories, and geometry reveals patterns that can emerge from complexity. These lessons shape my approach to teaching.

## Principles that guide my work

- **Logic provides an anchor** — clear thinking protects us from distortion when the world feels noisy.
- **Curiosity is a strategy** — inquiry keeps us moving when the path is not fully visible.
- **Learning is relational** — confidence, agency, and community matter as much as content.
- **Multiple futures are possible** — students should learn to choose and shape their direction, not merely inherit it.

My work — across mathematics classrooms, learning analytics, intergenerational community projects, and embodied nature-based explorations — aims to help learners build internal coherence in an incoherent world. I want students to be equipped rather than overwhelmed: able to act, to shape systems, and to form meaningful, humane communities.

Education in uncertain times must give students more than skills. It must give them clarity of thought, confidence of action, and compassion in community. This is the lighthouse we offer: not the removal of the storm, but the ability to steer through it — using logic, imagination, resilience, and hope.
